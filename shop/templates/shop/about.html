          <p class="card-text">Indian e-commerce company based in New Delhi, India. It was founded by Lokesh Aggarwal in 2020. The company initially focused on daily life product sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

            The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2020, ELACART held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.We are significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. We also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
            
            In August 2019, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.</p>
